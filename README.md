Attempt to make a clean standalone desktop application in HTML5 using electron. I already know angular 2, but unfortunately, the build tool that I am familiar with known as **anuglar-cli** (ng-cli) [doesn't work with electron](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/4227).

I am kinda working on this project passively, but if the star count on the github project page increases even by 1, I will make sure to put more effort that day.

**Also** I will document each step as I go along, explaining each piece of technology used in the most succinct manner in this Readme. 

And this readme will never get too long. PROMISE.
